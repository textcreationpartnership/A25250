            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is wonderfull to conſider, how Nature hath provided for all creatures, birds with feathers, beaſts with hides, fiſhes with ſcales, all with ſome defence, onely man is born ſtark naked, without either weapon in his hand, or the leaſt thought of defence in his heart; birds can flie, beaſts can go, fiſhes can ſwim, but infant-man, as he knows nothing, ſo neither is he able to do any thing: indeed he can weep as ſoon as born, but not laugh (as ſome obſerve) till fortie dayes old: ſo ready are we born to wo, but ſo farre from the leaſt ſpark of joy.

                  <hi>waſhing away your ſins with tears,</hi> that I fear you never took much notice of the multitude of your ſins: ſhould I tel you that you brought ſin enough with you to damn you, when you firſt came into this world; ſhould I tell you, that you have everie one committed thouſands, and thouſand of thouſands of actuall ſins and yet any one of thoſe thouſands is enough to ſend you packing to hell: You would think theſe ſtrange points; but if God be true, there is no ſin of man, either originiall or actuall, either of omiſſion or commiſſion, either of the bodie, or of the ſoul, which without repentance will not produce eternall death: and therefore in Gods fear take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your ſins, ſet before you the Commandments of God, and thereto comparing your life, you may find out ſuch a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of your ſinnes, that will throughly convince you of your damnable eſtate,</p>
               <p>You may ask, to what end ſhould we be ſo carefull to find out our ſins? I anſwer to a very good end, both in reſpect of the
<list>
                     <item>Unregenerate,</item>
                     <item>Regenerate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the unregenerate: this is the firſt ſtep of repentance; this is one of thoſe paces that will lead you towards heaven. You may be ſure, without repentance no heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confeſſion no repentance, and without finding out ſin there can be no confeſſion. It were good therefore, and a ſingular means to bring you out of corruption into Chriſtianity, and out of the ſtate of nature into the kingdome of grace, that you would everie one of you have a Catalogue of your ſins. If you will not, I can tell you who will, there is an adverſary called
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39460:15"/> 
                  <hi>Sathan</hi> (the adverſary of mankind) that ſtands at your back, and (I may ſay figuratively) with a ſcroll in his hands, wherein he writes down your ſins; not a day paſſeth on, but he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tell how many ſins you have committed all day. Lord, that men would think on't! Are you about any ſin? at that very time Sathan is regiſtring the act, and time and place, and everie circumſtance: now wo, wo to man, that lets Sathan do his work for him! Would you do this your ſelf, would you but ſtudy for a Catalogue of your own ſins, that ſo you might confeſs them to God, and repent you thereof, this would be a daſh in the devils book, ſo that he could not have whereof to accuſe you; but if ſtill you go on ſecurely in ſin, and never go about to call your ſins to remembrance, a day will come (wo worth the day) when that roring Lion ſhall ſet all your ſins and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions in order before you: then ſhall you read (perforce) your ſinnes originall and actuall, of omiſſion and commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of your bodies and ſouls. And I muſt tell you, herein is a great policie of Sathan, he lets you alone in your ſecuritie a while, if you will not trouble him, he will not trouble you; if you will not tell your own ſinnes, neither will he tell you of them; but he will change his note (at furtheſt) when your <hi>few evil dayes</hi> finiſh: it is the very caſe as many creditours deal with their debtors, while they have any doings as they ſay, and are in trading, they will let them alone, in policie they will ſay nothing; but if once down the wind, in ſickneſs, povertie, diſgrace, or the like, then comes Serjeant after Serjeant, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt upon arreſt, action upon action: juſt thus is Satans deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the unregenerate man; if you will but ſinne, and never call your ſelves to a reckoning, inpolicie he will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but when the ſcore is full, and death comes to arreſt you, then will he bring out his black book of all your ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all your <hi>dayes.</hi> O I tremble to ſpeak of it! then ſhall your ſins fall as foul on your ſouls, as ravens on the fallen ſheep, and keep you down for ever in the dungeon of deſpair.</p>
               <p>Secondly in reſpect of the regenerate; that you have readie by you (or by heart) a catalogue of your ſinnes, is neceſſary in many reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to humble you: for no ſooner ſhall the poor ſoul look on all the ſinnes he hath committed, both before and after
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39460:15"/> his regeneration, but confeſſing them in prayer, it will pull down his heart, and make the wound of his remorſe to bleed a freſh, as before: and therefore this catalogue is moſt neceſſary in dayes of humiliation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is neceſſarie to prepare you for the receiving of the Sacrament; for indeed I would have none to preſume to taſte on that Supper, but firſt to view over all his ſinnes, and to confeſs them in payer to his heavenly Father: there be many that in Confeſſion look on their ſinns, as they do on the ſtars in a dark cloudie night, they can ſee none but the great ones, of the firſt or ſecond magnitude, it may be here one and there one; but if they were truly illightened, and informed aright, they might rather behold their ſinns, as thoſe innumerable ſtars that appear in a fair froſtie winters night; they are many, and many: and therefore take a little pains in compoſing your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, that ſo you may confeſs all (at leaſt for the kinds) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you preſume to come near that Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is neceſſarie in times of deſertion, or viſitation: yea, if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to exerciſe you with any croſſe, or diſgrace, or diſcountenance, loſſe of goods, diſeaſe of bodie, terrour of ſoul, or the like; you may be ſure as no miſerie comes but for ſinne, ſo then the enumeration of your ſinns from a bleeding broken heart, is the prime and firſt means to cauſe that Sun of mercie to break through the clouds, and to beget a clear day; alas, our <hi>dayes</hi> are <hi>evil,</hi> and ſure we have as good reaſon as ever <hi>Jacob</hi> had to confeſs it: for my part, though I keep my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue to my ſelf, yet in the generall I cannot but confeſſe to you all, <hi>My dayes have been evil, evil, evil: Few and evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And now we have done with the work, it reſts that you ſhould know your wages; there be dayes of ſinn, and then dayes of ſorrow; as you have ſpent your dayes, ſo muſt you have your rewards; firſt we treſpaſſe, and then we pay for it; firſt we ſin, and then we ſuffer <hi>evil.</hi>
               </q>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The evils that we ſuffer may be ranked in this order; firſt, <hi>evils originall</hi> fill up the ſcene, and what a multitude of <hi>evils</hi> do enter with them? No ſooner had <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, but a world of miſeries fell on man, ſo that as the infection, in like manner the puniſhment diſtills from him.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>By one man</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>entred ſin into the world:</hi> what, ſin alone? no, but <hi>death
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39460:16"/> by ſinne, and ſo death went over all men</hi> Rom. 5.12. Infants themſelves bring their damnation with them from their wombs; or if that be omitted, how many are the miſeries of this life, as the fore-runners of that judgement? Look at the <hi>mind</hi> and what think ye of our <hi>ignorance,</hi> not onely that of wilfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but (as the Schools diſtinguiſh) of pure negation; if it be not a ſin, what is it but a puniſhment for ſinne? that our underſtanding ſhould be obſcured and darkened, our knowledge in things naturall wounded, in ſupernaturall utterly extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: O the miſerable iſſue of that monſter Sin! But as <hi>evils</hi> come by heaps, ſo of the ſame parent here is another brood, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Forgetfulneſs;</hi> and is not this a miſerie, after all our time and ſtudie to get a little knowledge, quickly to forget that we are ſo long a learning? Man in his whole ſtate, before the fall, could not forget things taught him; but now (as the hour-glaſs) we receive in at the one ear, and it goes out at the other; or rather (like the ſieve) we alwayes keep the bran, but let the flowre go, ſo apt are we to retain the bad, but we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie eaſily forget the good. And is this all? nay, yet more <hi>evils;</hi> ſee but our <hi>affections,</hi> and to what a number of infinite ſorrows, griefs, anguiſhes ſuſpicions, fears, malices, jealouſies, is the ſoul of man ſubject? So prone are we to theſe miſerable paſſions, that upon any occaſion we fall into them; or for want of cauſe from any other, we begin to be paſſionate with our ſelves: <hi>Why haſt thou, O Lord, ſet me againſt thee? I am become irksome and burdenſome even unto mine own ſelf,</hi> Job 7.20.<note place="margin">Job 7.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Alas, poor man how art thou beſet with a world of miſeries? and yet, as if all theſe ſummed up together, could not make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, look at the body, and how many are its ſufferings? <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat thy bread,</hi> ſaid God, Gen. 3.19.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> The Spider ſpins, and weaves, and waſtes her very bowels to make her net, and when all is done, to what purpoſe ſerves it, but to catch a flie? If this be vain work, how vain is man in his fond imitation? the birds and beaſts can feed themſelves, without any pains, onely man toils night and day, on ſea and land, with bodie and mind; yet all is to no purpoſe, but to catch a flie, to protract a life, or to procure ſome vanitie. And yet, as if miſerie had no mean; beſides our <hi>induſtry,</hi> how is this bodie ſtuffed with many an <hi>infirmitie?</hi> all the ſtrength of man is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39460:16"/> but a reed, at beſt ſhaken, perhaps broken, howſoever weakened by every wind that blows upon it. The Phyſicians diſtinction of <hi>Temperamentum ad pondus, &amp; juſtitiam,</hi> gives us thus much to learn, that no conſtitution is ever ſo happie, to have a juſt temper according to its weight; ſome are too hot others too cold all have ſome defects, and ſo are diſpoſed to all kind of <hi>infirmities:</hi> man cannot carrie himſelf, but he muſt needs carry about with him many forms of his own deſtruction.<note place="margin">De ipſo corpore tot exſiſtunt morborum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, ut nec libris Medicorum cuncta compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſa, <hi>Aug. de Civ.

                  </note> The books of the Phyſicians tell us of many diſeaſes, and yet many are the diſeaſes which their books cannot tell of: we ſee in our own dayes, moſt labour of new ſickneſſes, unknown to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or if any of us be free from any of theſe, yet everie ones bodie nouriſheth the cauſes, and may be a receptacle of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand diſeaſes.

                  <hi>and him crucified?</hi> this was the knowledge taught him by the Spirit of God in a wonderfull manner. <hi>Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings haſt thou, O God, ordained ſtrength.</hi> To conſider again his religious words, his upright acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his hearty devotions, his fear of God, all then concluded, as they did of <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 1.66.</note> 
                  <hi>What manner of child ſhall this be?</hi> No queſtion the grace of God was with him. If I ſhould inſtance in any of theſe his frequencie in prayer, his reading of Scripture, his reaſoning with others to get knowledge to himſelf, we may wonder at Gods power in this childs poor weakneſs: Excuſe me whiles I tell nothing but truths, and I hope they will tend to our own inſtruction. In the morning he would not ſtir out of doors, before he had poured out his prayers; at noon he would not eat any meat, before he had given the Lord thanks; at night he would not lie down on his bed, before he had kneeled down on his knees: we may remember thoſe times, when ſometimes that he had forgotten this dutie, no ſooner had he been in bed, but up he would have got again, and ſo kneeling down on his bare knees, covered with no garment but his linens, he would ask God forgiveneſs for that ſinne of forgetfulneſs; neither have his brothers eſcaped without his reprehenſion: for had they eat any meal or meat without a grace, his check was uſuall; <hi>Dare you do thus? unleſs God be mercifull unto us, this bit of bread might choke us.</hi> The wiſe ſentences, the religious words, which often dropt from his mouth like honey can we remember them, and not grieve at the death of him that ſpake them? What comfort had we in thoſe dayes? What ſorrow have we to think thoſe dayes are done? Surely we cannot ſpeak it without bitterneſs of ſoul, <hi>they are gone,</hi> they <hi>have been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he lived: will you know how he died? Firſt, a lingring ſickneſs ſeized upon him, againſt which to comfort him, one tells him of poſſeſſions that muſt fall to his portion: <hi>And what are they?</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I had rather have the Kingdome of Heaven, then a thouſand ſuch inheritances.</hi> Thus he minds Heaven; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39460:22"/> God, ſo minding him, preſently ſent him his ſickneſs that ſhould ſummon him thither. And now how ſhould I repeat his words with the life that he ſpake them dying? No ſooner had God ſtruck his body with that fatall ſickneſs, but he asks, and needs would know his ſouls eſtate: <hi>I have heard of the ſoul</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>but what is the ſoul? the mind?</hi> he queſtions, and queſtioning anſwers, better (I fear) then many, too many gray headed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; but the anſwer given, how the ſoul conſiſted of the Will and the Underſtanding, he ſayes, <hi>he is ſatisfied, and now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands better then he did before.</hi> Another comes to him, and then he begins another queſtion, now he knows the ſoul, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires yet to know further, <hi>How his ſoul may be ſaved?</hi> O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoul, how wiſely couldſt thou queſtion for thine own ſouls good! The anſwer given, <hi>by faith applying Chriſts merits:</hi> he heard it, and had it, anon telling them, who before had taught it him. Reſolved in theſe queſtions, he queſtions no further, but will now anſwer them, that go about to queſtion him: One asks him, whether he had rather live or die, he gives the anſwer, and not without <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon, <hi>I deſire to die</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I might go to my Saviour.</hi> O bleſſed Spirit, bow didſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into this child thy wiſdome and goodneſſe! This done, his pain begins again to afflict him, and this occaſions another thus to queſtion him, whether he would rather ſtill endure thoſe pains or forſake his Chriſt? <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I know not what to ſay as a child, for theſe pains might ſtagger a ſtrong man, but I will ſtrive to endure the beſt I can.</hi> Upon this he preſently calls to mind that Martyr, who being in priſon,<note place="margin">Thom. Bilney.</note> the night before his burning put his finger in the candle, to know how he could endure the fire; <hi>O</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>had I lived then, I would have runne through the fire to have gone to Chriſt.</hi> Sweet reſolution of a ſilly child! who can hear, and not wonder? wonder, and not deſire to hear that he may wonder ſtill? Bleſſed child, hadſt thou lived that we might have wondred at thy wiſdome! but his daies were determined, and now is the number turned to this poor cypher, they are not, they <hi>have been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot leave him yet, his ſickneſſe laſts long, and at leaſt three dayes before his death, he propheſies his departure, and how ſtrange a prophecie? not onely that he muſt die, but fore-telling the very day, <hi>On the Lords day</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>look to me.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:39460:23"/> Neither was this a word of courſe, which you may gueſſe by his often repetition, every day asking till the day came indeed, <hi>What, is Sunday come?</hi> At laſt the lookt-for day came on, and no ſooner had the Sun beautified that morning with his light, but he falls into a trance; What (think ye) meant his bleſſed ſoul, whileſt the body it ſelf uſed ſuch an action? his eyes were fixed, his face chearfull, his lips ſmiling, his hands and arms claſping in a bow, as if he would have received ſome bleſſed Angel, that there was at hand to receive his ſoul; but he comes to himſelf, and tells them how <hi>he ſaw the ſweeteſt boy that ever eyes beheld,</hi> and bids them, <hi>Be of good chear, for he muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently go with him.</hi> One ſtanding near, as now ſuſpecting his time of diſſolution, bids him ſay, <hi>Lord, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit;</hi>

Now I am well, my pain is almoſt gone, my joy is at hand, Lord have mercy on me, O Lord receive my ſoul unto thee.</hi> Where am I whileſt I ſpeak theſe words? Bleſſed Saint, now thou ſingeſt in Heaven, God hath bid thee welcome, the Angels are hugging thee, the Saints rejoyce with thee, this day is the Crown ſet on thy head, this day is the Palm of victory in thy hand now art thou array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſhining robes of Heaven, and all the Hoſt do triumph at thy corronation.

                  </label> NO other but <hi>This?</hi> were it a fortnight, a ſeven-night, any but <hi>This]</hi> night, and his griefs were leſſened; the news is more heartleſſe in that it comes more ſudden. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Then are the greateſt loſſes when they come on us by heaps, and without fear or ſuſpicion of any ſuch matter.</hi> Here was a man ſwimming in his fulneſſe, and a ſudden death robs him of all his treaſures. To give you a full view, ſee his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how great was the loſſe, becauſe of the ſuddenneſſe: <hi>This]</hi> night.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, thoſe <hi>goods,</hi> whereof he boaſted, are now confiſcate; not a peny, not a dram, not a mite ſhall be left him, ſave onely a token of remembrance (I mean his winding-ſheet) which he carries along with him to his grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, his <hi>goods and grounds</hi> both were took from him at his death; he that commanded ſo much of earth muſt now have no more earth to pleaſure him but a grave; what a change was this? his <hi>grounds</hi> were fertile,<note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> and they brought forth <hi>plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> but a blaſt of death hath ſtruck both the fruit and <hi>ground;</hi> and nothing is now left him but a barren Tombe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, his <hi>lands and houſes</hi> both went together. You may gueſſe that great demeans muſt have ſtately Halls: we read of his building, and eſpecially of his Barns; when theſe were too little for his ſtore, he tells us, he will <hi>pull them down, and he will build greater.</hi> He never thinks of any little room in the bowels of the poor. Was his harveſt ſo great that his barns would not hold it? Whence came the bleſſing but from God? How is it then he forgets God that beſtowed this bleſſing? It is written, <hi>When ye reap the harvest of the Land, ye ſhall not reap every corn of your field, neither ſhalt thou gather the gleanings of the harveſt.</hi> How? not reap it? not gather it? what then? why, <hi>Thou ſhalt leave them for the poor, and for the ſtranger: I am the Lord your God,</hi> Levit. 19.9.<note place="margin">Lev. 19.9, 10.</note> When <hi>Ruth</hi> came to glean in the fields of <hi>Boaz,</hi> that good Maſter commands his ſervants,<note place="margin">Ruth 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Let her gather among the ſheaves, and do not rebuke her.</hi> Had this Worldling been ſo pitifull to the poor, his barns might have ſtood, himſelf might have lived, his ſoul have been ſaved. But now what a ſtrange lot happens on him? his Halls, Houſes, Barns,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39460:26"/> Buildings, all runne round in a dance of Death before his eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, his <hi>houſe and friends</hi> both left him when death came: The Parable is common:<note place="margin">Ex Damaſceno</note> A man hath three <hi>friends,</hi> two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he loved moſt entirely, the third he made no account of: this man being ſent for to come before his King, he deſires his firſt <hi>friend</hi> to go with him, but he could not, onely he would give him ſomething for his journey: He deſires his ſecond <hi>friend</hi> to go with him, but he would not, onely he would bring him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piece of his way: When both theſe forſook him, he goes to the laſt, which before he eſteemed leaſt, and this <hi>friend</hi> was the party that went with him to the King, and anſwered for him in all his cauſes: This is the caſe of every man dying; the King our Judge ſends death his Serjeant to ſummon you to your judgement. Come to your firſt <hi>friends,</hi> (I mean your riches) alas! they cannot go with you, but give you a ſheet as neceſſary for your journey: Come to your ſecond <hi>friends</hi> (I mean your acquaintance) alas! they wil not go with you, but bring you to your graves, and there leave you to your ſelves: Come to your laſt <hi>friends,</hi> which you now leaſt think of (I mean your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences) and you ſhall find that is the trueſt <hi>friend</hi> that will go with you to the Judge, anſwer for you to the King, and either acquit you, or condemn you; bring you to the gates of heaven, or deliver you to the goal of hell. Have a care of your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> if you mean to ſpeed well at this day: how bleſſed a man had this Worldling been, if onely a good <hi>conſcience</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to the Judge of heaven? but now when death ſummons him, there is no <hi>friend</hi> to ſolicite, no Advocate to plead no man to ſpeak one word in his ſouls behalf: it is his <hi>bad conſcience</hi> keeps him company, and though all others leave him, he can deviſe no means to ſhake this from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, there is a jewell irrevocable, of which this ſudden death robs him, I mean his <hi>time,</hi> and what a loſſe was this? all his goods, grounds, barns, buildings, were they more worth then the world it ſelf, yet were they not able to reſtore one minute of his time: if this could be purchaſed, what a rate would he give for a little reſpite? nothing is now ſo precious as a piece of <hi>time,</hi> which before by moneths and years he laviſhly miſ-ſpent: they that paſſe away <hi>time</hi> with mirth and <hi>paſtime,</hi> ſhall one
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39460:26"/> day ſee to their grief what a loſſe they have; now we revell it out, dally it away, uſe all means and occaſions to make it ſhort enough; but when this golden ſhowre is gone, and thoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſalvation loſt by negligence, then we may wiſh, and wiſh again, <hi>Oh had we a little time, a little ſpace to repent!</hi> Imagine that this worldling (whom now you muſt ſuppoſe to lie frying in hel flames) were diſpenced with for a little <hi>time,</hi> to live here again on earth amongſt us; would but the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe him one hour of a new triall, a minute ſeaſon of a gracious viſitation, oh how highly would he prize, how eagerly would he apprehend, with what infinite watching, praying, faſting, would he improve that ſhort time, that he might repent him? I know not how effectually this may work an your hearts, but I am fully perſwaded, if any damned creature had but the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to hear this Sermon, you ſhould ſee how his very heart would bleed vvithin him; bleed ſaid I? nay, break and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder in his breaſt like drops of vvater. Oh vvith vvhat infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med attention vvould he hear and liſten? vvith vvhat inſatiable graſping vvould he lay hold on Chriſt? vvith vvhat ſtreaming tears vvould he vvater his cheeks, as if he vvould melt himſelf, like <hi>Niobe,</hi> into a fountain? Bleſſed God! hovv fond are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh men that never think of this till their <hi>time</hi> be loſt? vve that are alive have onely this benefit of opportunity, and if vve neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, a day vvill come (vve knovv not hovv ſoon) that vve ſhall be paſt it, and cannot recover it, no not one houre, if vve vvould give a thouſand, ten thouſand, vvorlds for it. What can I ſay? reflect on your ſelves, you that have ſouls to ſave; you have yet a little <hi>time</hi> (and the <hi>time</hi> preſent is that time) vvhat then, but ſo uſe it novv, as vvhen you are gone, you need not vvith grief vviſh you here again?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, yet more loſſe, and that is the loſſe of loſſes, the loſſe of his <hi>ſoul;</hi> his <hi>riches, lands, houſes, friends, time,</hi> and all were nothing to his <hi>ſoul.</hi> This is that Paragon, Peere, Roſe, and Spouſe of our well-beloved Chriſt. How many a teare ſhed he to ſave it? what grones cryes, prayers, teares, and bloud, poured he before God, that he might redeem it from the jawes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? and is this loſt notwithſtanding all this labour? O ſweet Jeſu! what a loſſe is this? thou waſt born, lived, died, and that a ſhamefull death, (the death of the croſs) and all this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39460:27"/> ſuffering was to ſave poor <hi>ſouls:</hi> yet ſee a <hi>ſoul</hi> here loſt, and the bloud of God, though able, not effectuall to redeem it. Whoſe heart would not melt into bloud, that but knew this miſery? Suppoſe you could ſee the <hi>ſoul</hi> of this wretched worldling, no ſooner had it left the body, but immediately was it ſeized on by infernall fiends, now lies it on a bed of fire, tortured, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſcourged, and ſcorched in thoſe furious flames; there his conſcience ſtings him, his ſorrow gripes him, his pain ſo han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles him, that he cryes, and roares, <hi>Woe, woe, and alas ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> Who now for ſhadows of ſhort pleaſures, would incur theſe ſorrows of eternall pains? In this world we can weep and wail for a loſſe of trifles: an houſe, a field, an Oxe took from us, is enough to cruciate us; but how ſhall we bewail the loſſe of a <hi>ſoul,</hi> which no ſooner plunged into that pit of horrour, but it ſhall feel a puniſhment without pity, miſery without mercy, ſorrow without ſuccour, crying without comfort, torment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eaſe, a world of miſchiefe, without all meaſure or redreſs?

               <p>Stay, what would <hi>death</hi> have? the <hi>ſoul</hi> cannot die, and for the <hi>body,</hi> no matter who receives it. O yes! there is a death of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> as well as of the <hi>body:</hi> I mean not ſuch a <hi>death</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

Such a Bayliffe hath now laid hands on this rich mans <hi>ſoul,</hi> when he leaſt thought on't, <hi>death</hi> comes on a ſudden, and arreſts his perſon.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39460:43"/> haſt denied me, thou haſt broken thy vow; hence Apoſtate, and bear with thee the ſentence of thy eternall damnation:</hi> at this voice he trembling and quaking fell down in a ſwoon; and after recovering himſelf, he profeſſed that he was captivated under the revenging hand of the great God of heaven, and that he heard continually that fearfull ſentence of Chriſt, now paſt on his own ſoul: his friends to comfort him propounded many of Gods promiſes, recorded in <hi>Scripture; Oh but my ſinne</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is greater then the mercy of God:</hi> nay, anſwered they, the mercy of God is above all ſinne; God would have all men to be ſaved: it is true (ſaid he) <hi>he would have all men that he hath elected to be ſaved; but he would not have Reprobates to be ſaved;</hi> and I am one of that number: after this roaring out in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of his ſpirit, he ſaid, <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> Theſe troubles of mind brought him to a diſtemper of body, which the Phyſicians perceiving, they wiſht him to ſeek ſome ſpirituall comfort: thoſe comforters come, and obſerving the diſtemper to ariſe from the ſence and horrour of hell pains; they ask him, Whether he thought there were any worſe pains then what he endured? he ſaid, <hi>He knew there were farre worſe pains; yet do I deſire nothing more,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>then that I may come to that place, where I may be ſure to feel the worſt, and to be freed from fear of worſe to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As on this manner he was ſpeaking he obſerved (ſaith my Authour) divers flies that came about him, and ſome lighted on him; whereat, preſently remembring how <hi>Belzeebub</hi> ſignifies the God of Flies; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>now alſo Belzeebub comes to his Banquet, you ſhall ſhortly ſee my end, and in me an example to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the juſtice and judgement of God.</hi> Then he began to reckon up what fearfull dreams and viſions he was continually troubled withall, <hi>That he ſaw the Devils come flocking into his chamber, and about his bed terrifying him with ſtrange noyſes; and that theſe were not fancies, but that he ſaw them as really as the ſtanders by: and that beſides theſe outward terrours, he felt continually a rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torture of his mind, and a continuall butchery of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being the very proper pangs of the damned wights in hel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of all the reſt, moſt deſperate was that laſt ſpeech of his, when ſnatching a knife (as intending to miſchief himſelf, but ſtopped by his friends) he roared with indignation, <hi>I would I

               <p>And now (beloved) if ſuch be the departure of a ſinnfull <hi>ſoul,</hi> O who would live in ſinne to come to ſuch a departure! For my part, I dare not ſay theſe parties, thus miſerable in their own apprehenſions, are now among Devils in hell: I find the Authours themſelves to incline to the right hand; beſides, what am I, that I ſhould ſit in Gods Chair? onely this I ſay, that their miſerable deaths may verie well give warning to us all; nor need you think much at me for uttering theſe <hi>(terribilia)</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſtories: for if ſometimes you did not hear of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt ſinne; a day might come, that you would moſt of all crie out on the Preacher: To this purpoſe, we have a ſtory of a certain rich man, who lying on his death-bed, <hi>My ſoul</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I bequeath to the Devil, who owns it; my wife to the Devil, who drew me to my ungodly life, and my Chaplain to the Devil who flattered me in it.</hi> I pray God I never hear of ſuch a Legacy from any of you: ſure I had better to tell you afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to prevent it, then not telling you to feel it.

How deſperate is their caſe, when none will comfort them? the Saints deride them, Angels mock them, their own friends ſcoffe them, devils hate them, the earth groans under them, and hell will ſwallow them. Down they go howling, and ſhrieking, and gnaſhing their teeth, the effect of a moſt impatient fury. The world leavs them, the earth forſakes them, hell entertains them, there muſt they live and die, and yet not live nor die, but dying live, and living die; death in life, life in death, miſerable ever. If the drowning of the old world, ſwallowing up of <hi>Korah</hi> and his complices, burning up of <hi>Sodom</hi> with brimſtone, were attended with ſuch terrours and hideous out-cryes, how infinitely tranſcendent to all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of conceit, expreſſion, or belief, will the confuſions and tremblings of that red-dread-fiery day be?

But the moſt horrid cry that ever was heard, or ever ſhall be heard in Heaven, or in Earth, in this world, or in the world to come, will be then when all the forlorn condemned reprobates upon ſentence given, ſhall be violently and unreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtably haled down to hel; neither ſhall any tears, or prayers, or promiſes, or ſuits, or cryes, or yellings, or calling upon <hi>Rocks and Mountains,</hi> or wiſhes never to have been, or now to be made nothing, be then heard, or prevail in their behalf: nay, (yet more to encreaſe their torments) there is not one in Earth or Heaven that will ſpeak one word in their behalf: but without mercy, without ſtay, without any farewell at all, they ſhall be immediately and irrecoverably caſt down into the bottomleſs pit of eaſeleſs, endleſs, and remedileſs torments. Oh! what then will be the gnawings of the never-dying worm? what rage of guilty conſciences? what furious deſpair? what horrour of mind? what diſtractions and fears? what tearing their hair, and gnaſhing of teeth?

               <p>We all come together to the Church, and amongſt us are <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>Wheat,</hi> good and bad; in all companies there will be evil intruders, Satan among the Angels, <hi>Saul</hi> among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles, <hi>Demas</hi> among the Profeſſours, yet who can diſcern the <hi>tares,</hi> but God alone who knows our hearts?

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as the <hi>Tares are hypocriticall,</hi> ſo are they <hi>hurtfull,</hi> they ſeem at unity, but are at enmity with the wheat about them: and theſe <hi>Tares</hi> are either <hi>hereticks,</hi> as moſt Fathers underſtood them; or any <hi>ſinner</hi> whoſoever, that is <hi>a child of the wicked one,</hi>

This infection (like the Tares) firſt begins <hi>whiles men ſleep,</hi> the Paſtours negligence gives way unto it, and becauſe of its little ſeed, or ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is never heeded, or regarded, till the whole houſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: thus Popery crept up in the dark, like a thiefe putting out the lights, that he might rob the houſe more ſecurely; and as it began with a little, ſo it went on by degrees, till an univerſall Apoſtaſie was (as it were) over the face of the world.<note place="margin">Vna ſcintilla fuit.

Hence it is, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſo triumphs over Chriſt, <hi>As for my followers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I never died for them as Chriſt did for his:</hi> no Devill, thou never diedſt for them, but thou will put them to a death without all eaſe or end. Think of this, yee unbelievers; me thinks like a thunderbolt, it might ſhake all your hearts, and daſh them into pieces.</p>

               <p>Others tell us of more evidences, and we ſhall reduce them to theſe heads; <hi>The teſtimonie of our ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit:</hi> It is not our ſpirit alone, nor Gods Spirit alone

               <p>
                  <hi>Inward tokens</hi> are certain ſpeciall graces of God imprinted in the ſpirit of a man, as <hi>godly ſorrow deſire of pardon, love of righteouſneſſe,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our ſecond and beſt aſſurance is the <hi>teſtimonie of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which ſometimes may ſuggeſt and teſtifie to the ſanctified conſcience thus, or in the like manner, <hi>Thou ſhalt be ſaved, thou ſhalt be] with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here I muſt ſatisfie two doubts: firſt, by what <hi>meanes</hi> the Spirit of God gives this particular aſſurance? ſecondly, <hi>how a man may diſcern</hi> betwixt the <hi>aſſurance of this Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>illuſion of Satan,</hi> who is the ſpirit of lies?</p>
               <p>To the firſt we ſay, <hi>the means</hi> is either by an immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or by a particular application of the promiſes in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,<note place="margin">John 3.36.</note> in form of an experimentall ſyllogiſme, as, <hi>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on the Son ſhall be ſaved;</hi> but I believe on the Sonne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall be ſaved. The <hi>major</hi> is Scripture, the <hi>minor</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by our faith, which if I have, I may ſay I believe: True, <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot ſay this,</hi> it is the operation of the holy Ghoſt; but if the work be wrought, and I feel this faith within my ſoul, what need I doubt but this aſſumption is true, <hi>I believe on the Son?</hi> Yet I hear ſome complain, they have neither ſight nor ſenſe of faith: and thus it is often with Gods deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: the Sunne that in a clear sky diſcovers and manifeſts it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:39460:106"/> ſelf, may ſometimes with clouds be overcaſt and darkened; and faith, that in the calmneſſe of a Chriſtian courſe ſhines, &amp; ſhews it ſelf clearly to the ſanctified heart, may ſometimes in the damp of ſpirituall deſertion, or darkneſſe of temptation, lie hid and obſcured: there is therefore in the Saints,<note place="margin">Certitudo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerentiae.</note> 
                  <hi>the aſſurance of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the aſſurance of adherence:</hi> The aſſurance of <hi>evidence,</hi> is that which is without ſcruple, and brings an admirable joy with it, and this more eſpecially appears either in our more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers, or in our heavenly meditations, or in time of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, or in ſome quickening exerciſes of extraordinarie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, or in beginning of our ſpirituall, or end of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, as moſt needfull times, then doth Gods ſpirit ſpeak comfortably to us, whiſpering to our ſouls the aſſurance of our happineſſe, that we ſhall be inheritours of his Kingdome. The aſſurance of <hi>adherence</hi> is that, which I doubt not the Saints have in their greateſt extremitie: for inſtance, many a faithfull ſoul, that makes conſcience of ſinne, lies and languiſhes upon the rack of fears and terrours, he ſhels nothing but a dead heart, and a ſpirituall deſertion, yet in the mean time his ſoul cleaves unto Chriſt, as to the ſureſt rock, he cries and longs after him, and for all his fears and ſorrows he will ſtill reſt upon him, <hi>Job</hi>-like, <hi>though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13.15.<note place="margin">Job 13.15.</note> Now this <hi>adherence</hi> unto Chriſt may aſſure him of ſalvation, for (if we ſpeak punctually and properly) faith juſtifying is not to be aſſured of pardon, but to truſt wholly upon Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and thus if he do, then may he with freedome of ſpirit ſay, <hi>I believe on the Sonne,</hi> whence ariſeth this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit, <hi>therefore I ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To our ſecond doubt, <hi>how we may diſcern</hi> betwixt the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Gods Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>illuſion of Satan?</hi> I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the teſtimony of Gods Spirit</hi> is ever agreeable to the Word, and thus to trie us, the Scripture tels us, that <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſinne,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. which is not to be underſtood ſimply of the act of ſinning, for <hi>who can ſay, my heart is clean?</hi> but in this ſenſe, <hi>he doth not commit ſinne,</hi> that is, he makes not a trade of ſinne, it doth not reign in him; if then thou alloweſt any luſt in thine heart, or goeſt on in the willing practice of any one known ſin &amp; yet haſt a conceit that thou art
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39460:107"/> ſure of ſalvation, alas, thou art deceived, <hi>thou haſt made a lie thy refuge, and hid thy ſelf under falſhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> breeds in the ſoul a Reverend love, and inſatiable longing after all good means appointed and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for our ſpiritual good: and therefore that heart which ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is affected and inflamed with the word and prayer, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and conference, and vows, and ſinging of Pſalms, and uſe of good books, we doubt not but it is breath'd on by the Spirit of God; whilſt others that uſe all theſe Ordinances out of cuſtome or formalitie, or ſome other ſiniſter end, alas, their conceit of being right, is built on the ſands, and therefore down it fals at deaths floud, and is overwhelmed in deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> is ever attended with the <hi>ſpirit of Prayer,</hi> and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We know not how to pray, but the ſpirit it ſelf, maketh interceſſion for us with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8.26.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> O the bleſſed opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Spirit! it even warms the ſpirit of a man with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning life, to pour out it ſelf in the preſence of the Lord his God, ſometimes in more hearty prayers, and ſometimes in more faint and cold, yet alwayes edged with infinite deſires that they were farre more fervent then they are: But on the other ſide, every deluded Phariſee is a mere ſtranger to the power of Prayer, if he prayes often (as I make it a queſtion) yet never prayes he from a broken heart, and this argues that all his confidence is no better then a weed which grows of its own accord, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like <hi>Jonahs gourd,</hi> when affliction comes, it withers on a ſudden.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit</hi> is often exerciſed and accompanied with fears, and jealouſies, and doubts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts; and varieties of temptations, which many times will drive the ſoul thus diſtreſt to cry mightily to God, to re-examine her grounds, to confirm her watch, to reſort for counſell where it may be had; whileſt on the contrary the Phariſees groundleſſe conceit lies in his boſome without fears, or jealouſies, or doubts, or diſtruſts, or any ſuch ado, why ſo? alas, Sathan is too ſubtle to trouble him in that caſe; he knows his foundation is falſhood, his hope of Heaven no better then a golden dream, and therefore in policie he holds his peace, that he may hold him the faſter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>the teſtimony of Gods Spirit</hi> is ever moſt refreſhing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39460:107"/> at thoſe times, when we retire our ſelves to converſe with God in a more ſolemn manner; when we feel that we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, or well curbed ſome corruption of nature; when we are well exerciſed in the Ordinances of God, or in our ſufferings by man for a good cauſe, and conſcience ſake; then (or at ſuch times) ſhall we feel that ſweetneſſe of the ſpirit cheriſhing our hearts with a lightſome comfort that cannot be uttered; whileſt on the contrary the deluded man is alwaies alike peremptorie in his confidence, you ſhall not take him at any time without a bold perſwaſion, that he hopes to be ſaved as wel as the beſt, thus like a man who lying faſt aſleep on the edge of a Rock, he dreams merrily of Crowns and Kingdomes, and will not off it, but on a ſudden ſtarting for joy, he tumbles into the bottome of the Sea, and there lies drowned in the deep; that aſſurance which is ever ſecure is but a dream whereas <hi>the teſtimony of Gods Spirit</hi> is ſometimes mixed with doubts, and ſometimes (to our unſpeakable comfort) with a ſecret, ſtill, heart-raviſhing voice thus ſpeaks to our conſciences, <hi>thou ſhalt be] thou ſhalt be] with me in paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>You ſee <hi>the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit,</hi> how it <hi>works in us,</hi> and how it is <hi>diſcerned by us;</hi> it <hi>works in us</hi> by a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the promiſes in the Goſpel, and is <hi>diſcerned by us by the word, by our love, our prayers, our fears, our joys</hi> at ſome times while we are a doing our duties.</q>

This ſudden unexſpected joy makes all more gratefull; to tell us of Crowns and Kingdomes that we muſt inherit, and then to put us off with delayes, abates the ſweetneſſe of the promiſe: men that go to ſuits for lands and livings, though Lawyers feed them with hopes, yet one order after another, ſpinning out time to a multitude of <hi>Terms,</hi>

               <p>But again you may object, That Chriſt rather that day, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into hel,</hi> then aſcended into heaven: The Creed teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that after he was <hi>crucified, dead, and buried, he deſcended into hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To anſwer the objection; ſome go about thus; by <hi>hel</hi> (ſay they) is meant <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where the ſoul of Chriſt was all the time that his body lay in the grave: If this be not a miſconſtruction, I am ſure it is no literall Expoſition, and me thinks a very ſtrange kind of figure it is, to expreſſe Chriſts <hi>aſcent into Paradiſe</hi> by his <hi>deſcent into hell.</hi> Others more probably underſtand Chriſts abode in the grave for the ſpace of three dayes.<note place="margin">Aug.

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> after ſome turns and wrenches concludeth thus: <hi>Eſt autem ſenſus multò expeditior, &amp;c. It is a farre eaſier ſenſe and freer from all ambiguity, if we take Chriſt to ſpeak theſc words, This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe] not of his Manhood, but of his Godhead; for the man Chriſt was that day in the grave accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, and in hell as touching his ſoul, but the ſame Chriſt as God is alwayes every where.</hi> Thus he: But this will

Now there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance but in regard of the ſoul, or man-hood, and therefore to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the God-head, were to aboliſh this analogy betwixt the firſt and ſecond Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons are weighty, but ſhould we ſay with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That Chriſt in his ſoul went down into hell, one of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies can tell us,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of his <hi>miſeries,</hi> he was a Thief condemned and crucified: we read of foure kinds of deaths in uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſtrangling, ſtoning, fire and the ſword: the Croſſe was a death whether for the pain, the ſhame, the curſe, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other: we may ſee it in that gradation of the Apoſtle, <hi>He became obedient to death, even to the death of the Croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2.8.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8,</note> What engine of torture was that? it ſpins out pain, it ſlowes his death, yet a little and a little till it be more then any man can think: ſee his hands bored, his feet nayled, <hi>his legs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> every part full of pain from top to toe, and thus hangs this Thief, the poyz of his body every moment increaſing his pain, and his own weight becoming his own affliction; in this caſe were not a quick riddance his beſt remedie? were not the news of death better then a lingring life? Lo then to his eternall comfort, Chriſt our Saviour <hi>(in the ſame condemnation)</hi> grants him his deſire: What would he have? a diſpatch of pain? he ſhall have it <hi>this day]</hi> as <hi>Samuels</hi> appearance ſaid to <hi>Saul, To morrow</hi> (yea, <hi>to day) thou ſhalt be with me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, here's a greater comfort, his <hi>miſeries have an end,</hi> and <hi>his joys are at hand;</hi> while he is even gaſping in deaths pangs, he is carried on a ſudden from earth to heaven, from his Croſſe to Paradiſe, from a world of wo to a kingdome of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and eternall bliſſe. O how bleſſed is the change, when in the very moment of miſery <hi>joy</hi> enters! Suppoſe you a poor man in the night time out of his way, wandring alone upon the mountains, far from companie, deſtitute of money, beaten with rain, terrified with thunder, ſtiff with cold, wearied with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, famiſhed with hunger, and near brought to deſpair with the multitude of miſeries; if this man upon a ſudden, in the twinkling of an eye, ſhould be placed in a goodly, large, and rich palace furniſhed with all kind of clear lights, warm fire, ſweet ſmels, dainty meats, ſoft beds, pleaſant muſick, fine appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, honourable company, and all theſe prepared for him, to ſerve him, honour him, and to anoint and crown him a King for ever; what would this poor man do? what could he ſay? ſurely nothing, but rather in ſilence weep for joy: Such, nay,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:39460:110"/> far happier was the caſe of this poor malefactour: he was like the man wandring on the mountains, full of as much pain as the croſſe could make him; but on a ſudden he and our Saviour cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him, both meet in his Kingdome: and now, Lord, what a joy enters into him, when he entred into heaven! on <hi>Calvary</hi> he had nothing about him, but the <hi>Iews</hi> at his feet, and the nails in his hands, and the Croſſe at his back; in ſtead where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no ſooner comes he to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> but the Angels, Archangels, <hi>Cherubims, Seraphims,</hi> all hug him, and embrace him; imagine with your ſelves, how was he aſtoniſhed, and as it were beſides himſelf at this ſudden mutation, and exceſſive honour done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him! Imagine with your ſelves what joy was that, when he met our Saviour in his glorie, whom that very <hi>day,</hi> he had ſeen buffeted, ſcourged, crowned, crucified; <hi>bleſſed day that could ever bring forth ſuch a change!</hi> Beloved, I know not how to expreſs it, but let your ſouls in ſome meditation flie up from <hi>Calvarie</hi> to Heaven; in the morning you might have ſeen Chriſt and this Thief hanging on two Croſſes, their bodies ſtretched, their veins opened, their hands and feet bleeding in abundance, the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be <hi>remembred</hi> of the other, and the other complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was <hi>forgotten of his Father:</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the <hi>will</hi> is for ever ſatisfied with a perfect inward, and eternall communion with God himſelf; Chriſt that is God and man, by his Man-hood aſſumed uniteth us unto God, and by his God-head aſſuming uniteth God unto us, ſo that by this ſecret and ſacred communion, we are made partakers (and as it were poſſeſſours) of God himſelf: O bottomleſſe depth, and deareſt confluence of joyes and pleaſures everlaſting! here is the perfection of all good things, the Crown of glory, the very life of <hi>Life everlaſting.</hi> And well may it be ſo, for what can the ſoul deſire, God will not be unto her?

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:39460:116"/> every Saint is a King, <hi>adorned with light as with a garment,</hi> and clad in the richeſt robes that God beſtows upon a creature.</p>
               <p>But that which more eſpecially commends the <hi>beauty</hi> of this Citie, is the luſtre of it, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn) no need of Sun or Moon,</hi> it is <hi>verus</hi>

               <p>Nor is this all; for <hi>the glorie of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof;</hi> beſides the native luſtre, there is the glorie of God, the glory of all glories; this is it for which <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory;</hi> to whom God anſwered, <hi>thou canſt not ſee my face and live, —but I will put thee in a cleft of the rock,</hi>
